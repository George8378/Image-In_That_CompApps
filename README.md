Image-in That
George Rassam, Javier Quiros, Kylie Gilmet

User should have 4 cardiac MRI images that are a filetype readable by matlab such as .jpg or .png.
The images should be a systolic short and long axis and diastolic short and long axis of the left ventricle.
Images should only show the left ventricle of the heart.

Download the MR_Heart_Sementation.m and the four .png test images.

sa_sys.png = short axis systolic
la_sys.png = long axis systolic
sa_dia.png = sort axis diastolic
la_dia.png = long axis diastolic

Run the matlab script.

When prompted, enter the filenames of the images that correspond to what the program is asking for.

The ejection fraction and sample binary image should appear soon after.
